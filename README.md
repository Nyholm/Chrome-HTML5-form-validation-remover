# Remove HTML5 Form Validation

This plugin is inspired by [damienalexandre](https://github.com/damienalexandre/form-validation-remover) but there 
one big different. This plugin disables form validation for all forms all the time. You just install and forget. 
With damienalexandre you need to click "disable" at every page load. 


Install the plugin from [the chrome webstore](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/auto-remove-html5-form-va/odfjmmehfeibapgipjbhdojkiemkbpik)
